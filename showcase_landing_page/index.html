        According to United Nations, as of 2018, Mumbai was the second most
        populous city in India after Delhi and the seventh most populous city in
        the world with a population of 19.98 million.[18] As per Indian
        government population census of 2011, Mumbai was the most populous city
        in India with an estimated city proper population of 12.5 million living
        under Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai.[19] Mumbai is the centre
        of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the sixth most populous metropolitan
        area in the world with a population of over 23.64 million.[20] Mumbai
        lies on the Konkan coast on the west coast of India and has a deep
        natural harbour. In 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world city.[21] It
        is also the wealthiest city in India,[22][23] and has the highest number
        of millionaires and billionaires among all cities in India.[24][25]
        Mumbai is home to three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Elephanta
        Caves, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, and the city's distinctive
        ensemble of Victorian and Art Deco buildings.

        People from Mumbai A resident of Mumbai is called Mumbaikar in Marathi,
        in which the suffix kar means a resident of. The term had been in use
        for quite some time but it gained popularity after the official name
        change to Mumbai.[67] Older terms such as Bombayite are also in
        use.[68][69]

          The name Mumbai is derived from Mumbā or Mahā-Ambā—the name of the
          patron goddess (kuladevata) Mumbadevi of the native Koli
          community—[44] and ā'ī meaning "mother" in the Marathi language, which
          is the mother tongue of the Koli people and the official language of
          Maharashtra.[28][45] The Koli people originated in Kathiawad and
          Central Gujarat, and according to some sources they brought their
          goddess Mumba with them from Kathiawad (Gujarat), where she is still
          worshipped.[29][30] However, other sources disagree that Mumbai's name
          was derived from the goddess Mumba

          The oldest known names for the city are Kakamuchee and Galajunkja;
          these are sometimes still used.[46][47] In 1508, Portuguese writer
          Gaspar Correia used the name "Bombaim" in his Lendas da Índia
          ("Legends of India").[48][49] This name possibly originated as the
          Galician-Portuguese phrase bom baim, meaning "good little bay",[50]
          and Bombaim is still commonly used in Portuguese.[51] In 1516,
          Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa used the name Tana-Maiambu: Tana
          appears to refer to the adjoining town of Thane and Maiambu to
          Mumbadevi.[52]

          By the late 20th century, the city was referred to as Mumbai or Mambai
          in Marathi, Konkani, Gujarati, Kannada and Sindhi, and as Bambai in
          Hindi.[58] The Government of India officially changed the English name
          to Mumbai in November 1995.[59] This came at the insistence of the
          Marathi nationalist Shiv Sena party, which had just won the
          Maharashtra state elections, and mirrored similar name changes across
          the country and particularly in Maharashtra.[60] According to Slate
          magazine, "they argued that 'Bombay' was a corrupted English version
          of 'Mumbai' and an unwanted legacy of British colonial rule."[61]
          Slate also said "The push to rename Bombay was part of a larger
          movement to strengthen Marathi identity in the Maharashtra
          region."[62] While the city is still referred to as Bombay by some of
          its residents and by Indians from other regions,[63][64] mention of
          the city by a name other than Mumbai has been controversial, resulting
          in emotional outbursts sometimes of a violently political nature
